### Nokogiri

### XML-Parsing
Extracts information stored in the XML document to avoid any of the difficulties that occur when reading and interpreting raw XML data.

The parser usually is a class library that reads a given document and checks that it is well-formed according to the W3C specification. Then, any client software can use methods of the interface provided by the parser API to access the information the parser retrieved from the XML file.


The parser shields the user from dealing with the complex details of XML like assembling information distributed over several XML files.
